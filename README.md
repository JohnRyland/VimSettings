Vim Settings

Check this out and then symlink the Vimrc file to ~/.vimrc to have the same settings I use.

Assumes various vim plugins/extensions etc are installed in your ~/.vim which should contain these directories if they are installed:

```
  .vim/plugged/vim-easy-align
  .vim/plugged/asyncrun.vim
  .vim/plugged/lldb.nvim
  .vim/spell
  .vim/tags/cpp_src
  .vim/colors
  .vim/autoload/omni
  .vim/after/ftplugin
```

Inside vim, you can type `:Help` to display some of the commands this adds that I commonly use. Try typing `~`, and `~` to close it again :)
